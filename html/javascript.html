    hello world <br>
    js is an dynamically typed language <br> it adapta changes automatically <br>var keyword eg <br>
    js is a functional language / procedure oriented language. <br>
    three ways to write js code . <br>
    best is to use src in html file to attach the js file and write js it in an external page <br>
    browser is the interpreter of js. <br>
    interpreter executes line by line <br>
    if we write linked js file in the beginning everything else after it will be blocked and first the script js will be processed and downloaded only then the rest of html will be processed <br>
    so that will lead to the page not loading till the whole sript js is processed <br>
    now to deal with it we can use <h3><u>DEFER</u></h3> <br>
    now defer will simultenously download html file and process java script <br>
    java script will only be executed when the entire html is downloaded <br>
    ctrl+shift+i used in webpages to open developer tools : <br>
    u can wite js code in console as well <br>
    lighthouse: loads a web page and analyses it , it checks it's better practices etc. <br>
    compared to c : js is a more friendly language; <br> 
    semicolon is only must between two statements : comments same as c; <br>
    whatever u write in script tag is available in console tab of dev tools; <br>
    js is a case sensetive language : if u wite A and small a it is considered differently ;
    if u write console.log() with capital C then console considers it as a error and says it is an undefined keyword : it's an error : <br>
    js dosen't need a data type decleration : we just need to use <u>var</u> as keyword <br> dynamically typed lang 
     here code-> var ab = 1;
console.log(ab)
VM2200:1 1
undefined
console.log(typeof ab);
VM2326:1 number : output;
undefined
var ab = "shambhavi"
undefined
console.log(typeof ab)
VM2495:1 string
undefined<br> c is strictly typed lang <br> ascii dosen't exist in c; <br>
it typecasts on it's own : code : 1+"1" ; output: '11'; <br> i.e. it is weekly typed language <br>it has it's own advantages and disadvantages <br>
finally , functional dynamically weekly typed language is js ;<br>
declearing var name same as c but $ and _ are allowed in var name <br>
js - need & use -dynamic pages : brings changes in the parent page during run time; <br>
const keyword for const var : it's value dosen't changes during run time ; <br>
to find out the data type of an object we can use typeof ; <br>
eg: 1.strings 2.numbers 2. null and undefined 3.primitive data types ; <br>

#concatenation : <br>
#replace : replaces one string with another <br>
 var url = "https://www.udemy.com";
undefined
console.log(url.replace("https:",""));
VM3609:1 //www.udemy.com  :: output <br>
it's always better to write first word in small and second word's first letter in caps when both the words are written together: <h4>it's a convection</h4> <br>
parsInt is used for type conversion of string into num; <br>
<h3>BOOLEAN</h3>
    until x is true (only in small caps) the if statement will work otherwise else will work <br>
    since js is an weekly typed lang : === & !== is used to check if the value as well as data type is same . <br>
    undefined means obj is empty <br> null means object hi nahi hai <br>
    <pre>
    array operations :
    push : add ele to end;
    pop : remove last element;
    shift: remove first ele and shifts;</pre> <br>
    if u use : slice(0,3)
     :: 0 is included and 3 is excluded <br>

 js allows u to create a global var and local var with the same name as well and this operator is used to acsses global variable and consider it as a local variable while also allowing a local variable data with the same name to exist <br>
 parsing engine in browser vonverts html to dom : in chrome parsing engine is V8 <br>
 dom let's every ele of html become a object for js that can be modified and changed using js . <br>
 document is an key word in js <br>
 document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "  Hello "    <br>
 document.getElementById - dom  obj ; <br>
 dom ele -.innerHTML ; <br>
